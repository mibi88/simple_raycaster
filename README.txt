That's the original readme of this project. Initially it was meant to be a
prototype but now it is a *quite* well optimized raycaster, i.e., it became the
raycaster which should succeed it, i.e., the raycasting game engine I talked
about.

    TODO

[ ] Optimize raycasting to avoid two divisions
[ ] Sprites

I may also add the following features if I'm motivated enough:

[ ] Floor and ceiling texturing
[ ] Camera pitch + view height
[ ] Variable height floor/ceiling
[ ] Angled walls

    KNOWN BUGS

[ ] Sprites not displayed in some cases when looking at them from behind.
